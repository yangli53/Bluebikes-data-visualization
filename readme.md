# Boston Bluebikes Data Analysis

## Dataset

Bluebikes is Metro Boston's public bike share program, with over 2,500+ bikes and more than 260+ stations across Boston, Brookline, Cambridge and Somerville. I downloaded its Q2 data (April, May and June) to explore bike usage in this area.

## Summary of Findings

My main findings are listed below:
1. Nearly three quarters of users are subscribers.
2. The majority of subscribers were born in 80s and 90s while the majority of customers were born in 60s and 90s.
3. The majority of subscribers are male and there are more females than males among customers.
4. Subscribers use bikes more often during peak hours on weekdays while customers use bike more often in the afternoon on weekends. 
5. Subscribers usually take short rides around 5-10 minutes while customers prefer to take longer ride.
6. All of the top 10 subscriber routes have either a start station or an end station at MIT; 9 of the top 10 customer routes have the same start station and end station.

## Key Insights for Presentation

According to the analysis, I can profile subscribers and customers as:
Subscribers: male, born in 80s and 90s, commuters
Customers: female > male, born in 60s and 90s, visitors

I could profile their biking habits as:
Subscribers take more short rides (5-15 minutes) at 8am and 5pm on weekdays while they use bikes more often from 10am to 7pm on weekends.
Customers take more short rides (10-25 minutes) at 5pm on weekdays while they take more longer rides from 12pm to 7pm on weekends.
